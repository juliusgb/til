# Ansible reads from KeePass

For small projects, I'd still like to handle their credentials carefully while keeping the effort small.

Since KeePass is a low-effort Password Manager, why not get automation tools to read credentials from KeePass?
Then, having been read, those credentials are available for downstream processes.

More details are in the [TIL entry](https://til.juliusgamanyi.com/posts/ansible-read-from-keypass/).
